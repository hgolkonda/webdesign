            <br>Human activity recognition is a broad field of study concerned with identifying the specific movement or action of a person based on sensor data. 
            <br>Movements are often typical activities performed indoors, such as walking, talking, standing, and sitting.
            <br>They may also be more focused activities such as those types of activities performed in a kitchen or on a factory floor.
            <br>Activity recognition is the problem of predicting the movement of a person, often indoors, based on sensor data, such as an accelerometer in a smartphone .
            <br>Streams of sensor data are often split into subs-sequences called windows, and each window is associated with a broader activity, called a sliding window approach. 
            <br>Convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks, and perhaps both together, are best suited to learning features from raw sensor data and predicting the associated movement.
            <br>We use Classification algorithms,Keras Deep learning,Adaboost,random forest algorithm .
            <br>we will be working in python.
