         <p>Restaurant style paneer tikka masala</p>
<h>Procedure with ingredients:</h>

<br>Take ½ cup chopped onions, 1 cup chopped tomatoes, 1 teaspoon chopped ginger (chopped) and 1 teaspoon chopped garlic in a grinder or blender jar.
Without adding any water, grind or blend to a smooth paste.
<br>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a thick-bottomed pot or pressure cooker. Add ½ teaspoon cumin seeds and cook until they crackle.
<br>You can use any neutral flavored oil. For a richer taste you can also use ghee (clarified butter).
<br>Now add the ground onion-tomato paste to the oil in the pan. Keep the heat to a low and also take care as the mixture splutters.
<br>Stir well and then add 1 tablespoon malai (the thick layer of cream floating on top of boiled cooled whole milk).

<br>Tip: The curry masala mixture splutters, so cover the pot or cooker partly with a lid.
<br>Once the mixture stops spluttering, then remove the lid and sauté.
<br>Stir often so that the curry masala does not get browned or gets stuck to the base of the pot.
<br>Sauté the ground paste till the oil releases from the sides and the masala paste thickens. You will see that the paste becomes glossy and comes together in a kind of lump.
<br>Then add a generous pinch of asafoetida (hing), ½ teaspoon red chili powder and ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder. Stir and mix the spice powders with the rest of the sautéed masala paste.
<br>Add 1 cup green peas and 2 large potatoes (peeled and diced) to the curry masala paste.
<br>Stir and sauté for a minute.
<br>If cooking in a pot, add 1.5 cups of water.
<br>Season with salt as required.
<br>Stir well and cover the pot with the lid.
<br>Simmer till the potatoes and peas are cooked tender. If necessary, you can add some more water.
<br>Lastly sprinkle in ½ teaspoon garam masala powder. Stir again.
<br>Then add 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves (cilantro).
<br>Stir well and serve Aloo Matar hot from the pan, preferably with Indian breads like poori, roti, paratha, naan or serve with steamed rice or cumin rice.
