            <p>If youâ€™re looking for a more adventurous way of losing weight, hiking might be the move for you. It
                usually involves walking in nature and avoiding the obstacles around you, like tree roots and rocks.
                Hiking can lead to weight loss, especially if you do it regularly.</p>

            <p>low-cost, versatile exercise for weight loss is stair climbing. Although you could use a machine, all you
                really need for this exercise is a trusty set of stairs. Climbing just two flights of stairs every day
                can lead to 6 pounds of weight loss in a year. It can also add to the amount of good cholesterol in your
                blood and help keep your joints, muscles, and bones healthy.</p>

            <p>Research says that Pilates -- exercises usually done on a mat or with various tools that emphasize core
                strength -- can make you stronger and help you keep a healthy weight. The intensity of a Pilates class
                depends on your needs. You can find some classes or demonstrations online or at your local gym.</p>
