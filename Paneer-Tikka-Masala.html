    <p>Restaurant style paneer tikka masala</p>
<h>Procedure with ingredients:</h>
 <p>In a large bowl, whisk 6 tablespoons hung curd until smooth.
1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste
¼ teaspoon turmeric powder
½ teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder
½ teaspoon garam masala powder
½ teaspoon coriander powder (optional)
2 to 3 pinches of grated nutmeg or nutmeg powder
1 generous pinch of crushed saffron or saffron powder
1 tablespoon of cornstarch or gram flour
½ teaspoon salt or as required
Add 1 teaspoon lemon juice
Mix everything very well.
Add the paneer cubes (250 to 300 grams), 1 medium-sized onion (layers separated and cut in squares), 1 medium bell pepper (cut in squares or cubes).
<br>Gently mix again so that the marination coats the paneer, onions and bell peppers evenly. Cover the bowl and marinate in the refrigerator for at least one hour and up to overnight.
<br>Line a baking tray or pan with aluminum foil or parchment. While this step is technically optional, this method makes it much easier to clean the pan later.
<br>Next, thread the paneer cubes and vegetables on bamboo or metal skewers and place them on the prepared pan. While you don’t have to skewer the paneer, I find that it makes for less work turning the cubes in all preparations.
<br>Brush about 1 to 2 teaspoons oil evenly on the paneer, onion and bell pepper cubes.
<br>Grill the skewered paneer cubes and veggies in a preheated oven at 200° C (390° F) for a total of 15 to 20 minutes (depending on the oven temperatures). Halfway through remove the skewers and turn over for even grilling.
<br>You can brown the edges a bit more if you want but do not overcook the paneer cubes.

 <br>Heat about 1 to 2 tablespoons oil in a flat pan or frying pan or a skillet until shimmering. Place the skewers on the pan and begin to pan fry them on medium heat.

<br>When one side is crisp and browned, gently rotate the skewers. Keep on rotating until all sides are browned. If necessary, add more oil to the pan while frying. 

<br>However you cook your paneer, you’ll want to remove the skewers and set the grilled paneer and vegetables to the side while you make your gravy.
